## 🚦 Migration Guide

### From AWS Serverless

```javascript
// AWS Lambda (Current) - $12K/month
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  // 16 different services
  // Cold start delays
  // Complex orchestration
};

// Infrastructure Assassin (New) - $0 cost
const response = await infrastructureAssassin.orchestrate({
  description: "Process complete workflow",
  tools: ["all_required_tools"]
});
// 1 API call, instant execution, zero infrastructure cost
```

### From Platform Fragmentation

```bash
# Multiple tools (Current) - $50K+/month
Base44 pricing + DeepCode pricing + Bolt.DIY pricing + AWS infra

# Infrastructure Assassin (New) - $100K/year
docker run infrastructure-assassin
# All tools unified, zero infrastructure cost
```
