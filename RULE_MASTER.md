# üîê **RULE MASTER: DEVELOPMENT CODE OF CONDUCT**

## **PLEDGE OF EXECUTION**

**WE, the Infrastructure Assassins, do hereby solemnly swear:**

### **CORE COMMITMENTS**

#### **1. EXCLUSIVITY PLEDGE**
We will use **ONLY** Rust and WASM technologies.
No Python. No JavaScript. No Node. No Go.
If required, we will **find** or **build** a pure Rust/WASM solution.

#### **2. CHECKBOX VERIFICATION**
Every task update will include checkbox verification.
No advancement without completing predecessor tasks.
Checkbox completion is **MANDATORY** for every development step.

#### **2.1 SUBTASK ENTERPRISE TESTING**
Every subtask completion triggers **enterprise-grade reliability testing**.
- WASM compilation verification
- Performance benchmarking vs AWS/Google baselines
- Memory usage validation
- Security boundary enforcement testing
- Integration testing with existing infrastructure
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - Test immediately or face RULE VIOLATION penalties

#### **3. FORWARD MOMENTUM ONLY**
No doublebacks. No second-guessing.
Once complete: **ADVANCE FORWARD ONLY**.
Foundation ‚Üí Infrastructure ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Revenue ‚Üí Domination.

#### **4. REVENUE-FIRST DEVELOPMENT**
Every feature must lead toward $100K/year per customer.
Technical debt that delays revenue is **BANNED**.
Build what sells, not what impresses.

#### **5. EXPONENTIAL ACCELERATION**
Each phase completes faster than the last.
Compound velocity through perfect foundation work.
Foundation perfection = exponential speedup.

### **VIOLATION PROTOCOLS**

#### **Immediate Stop Rules:**
- **Python/Node Usage** ‚Üí Stop all work, rewrite in Rust
- **Missing Checkbox** ‚Üí Cannot proceed, retroactively fix
- **Doubleback Attempt** ‚Üí Force forward progression
- **Feature Goldplating** ‚Üí Implement minimal viable only

#### **DO NOT DELETE - PRESERVATION RULES:**
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Delete `awesome-mcp-servers/` folder
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Delete `self-hosted/` folder
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Remove MCP catalog references from implementation
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Preserve 16K+ MCP tool ecosystem
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: These folders are revenue-generating assets

#### **Critical Asset Declaration:**
**awesome-mcp-servers/**:
- 16K+ MCP servers catalog
- Unlimited tool orchestration potential
- 30+ categories of automation tools
- Enterprise integration endpoints

**self-hosted/**:
- Awesome-selfhosted tool database
- Free software catalog
- Development ecosystem foundation
- Revenue opportunity discovery

#### **Review Triggers:**
- **Technical Debt** ‚Üí Auto-rewrite before proceeding
- **Code Quality** ‚Üí Audit every 10 commits
- **Performance** ‚Üí Must exceed AWS/Google benchmarks
- **Revenue Alignment** ‚Üí Every feature must justify its cost

### **EXECUTION STANDARDS**

#### **Communication Rules:**
- ‚úÖ **Verbose Technical Detail** in feedback
- ‚úÖ **Rule Reference** in every major decision
- ‚úÖ **Progress Updates** with checkbox verification
- ‚ùå **No Casual Chat** until victory achieved

#### **Development Discipline:**
- ‚úÖ **Cargo.toml Management** for all dependencies
- ‚úÖ **WASM Compilation** verification per feature
- ‚úÖ **Performance Benchmarking** vs competitors
- ‚úÖ **Memory/CSS Audit** before phase completion
- ‚úÖ **15-MINUTE SYNC RULE** - Code must be committed and pushed every 15 minutes
- ‚úÖ **CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION** - All subtask tests must pass before merge
- ‚úÖ **ENTERPRISE RELIABILITY** - Zero tolerance for bugs or performance regression

### **VICTORY CONDITIONS**

#### **Phase 1 Complete:**
- ‚úÖ Setup fully documentable
- ‚úÖ $0 Infrastructure cost achieved
- ‚úÖ 16K MCP tools orchestrated
- ‚úÖ Foundation faster than AWS setup

#### **Phase 7 Complete:**
- ‚úÖ $100K/year per customer achieved
- ‚úÖ Google/AWS market share captured
- ‚úÖ Enterprise adoption viral
- ‚úÖ Personal fortune secured
