# Implementation Plan

[Overview]
Build the Infrastructure Assassin - a unified Rust/WASM platform that combines AutoAgents foundation with MCP server orchestration to create a $2.5M revenue generating platform that disrupts AWS/Google serverless infrastructure by offering $0 cost development with 10x productivity gains through infinite tool orchestration. This platform replaces Base44, DeepCode, Lovable, Bolt.DIY, Langfuse, DIFY, and countless other tools with one pure Rust/WASM solution running in lightweight Docker containers.

The implementation focuses on creating headless browser spawning capabilities integrated with the existing AutoAgents multi-agent orchestration system, enabling ephemeral serverless function execution that destroys itself post-task completion while maintaining zero-trust security through WASM sandboxing.

[Types]
The type system will preserve existing AutoAgents foundation while extending core abstractions:

```rust
pub struct HeadlessBrowserFactory {
    pub wasm_runtime: WasmRuntime,
    pub sandbox_config: SandboxIsolation,
    pub agent_orchestrator: ActorSystem<Task>,
}

pub struct EphemeralToolChain {
    pub mcp_servers: Vec<McpServerConfig>,
    pub execution_context: WasmContext,
    pub security_boundaries: ZeroTrustPolicy,
    pub lifecycle_manager: SelfDestructChain,
}

pub struct RevenueAnalytics {
    pub aws_cost_saved: f64,
    pub productivity_gain: f64,
    pub tool_orchestrations: u64,
    pub enterprise_customers: u32,
}

pub struct InfrastructureMetrics {
    pub memory_usage: usize,
    pub cpu_cycles: f64,
    pub gpu_acceleration: f64,
    pub network_latency: f64,
    pub container_efficiency: f32,
}
```

[Files]
New files to be created (all in Rust/WASM):
- `crates/infrastructure-assassin/src/lib.rs` - Core orchestration engine
- `crates/infrastructure-assassin/src/browser/factory.rs` - Headless browser spawning
- `crates/infrastructure-assassin/src/orchestration/agent_chain.rs` - Multi-agent task coordination
- `crates/infrastructure-assassin/src/security/zero_trust.rs` - WASM sandboxing
- `crates/infrastructure-assassin/src/analytics/revenue.rs` - Cost disruption metrics
- `crates/infrastructure-assassin/src/tools/mcp_orchestrator.rs` - 16K+ MCP tool management

Existing files to be modified:
- `crates/autoagents/src/lib.rs` - Add headless browser integration
- `crates/core/src/agent/builder.rs` - Extend with ephemera capabilities
- `crates/core/src/tool/runtime/wasm.rs` - Inject browser automation

Configuration updates:
- `cline_mcp_settings.json` - Add headless browser server
- `Rule MASTER.md` - Document phase completion protocols

[Functions]
New functions (all pure Rust, zero external dependencies):

Headless Browser Factory:
```rust
pub fn spawn_ephemeral_browser(config: BrowserConfig) -> Result<BrowserSession, Error>
pub fn inject_browser_automation(context: &WasmContext) -> Result<(), Error>
pub fn destroy_browser_sandbox(session: BrowserSession) -> Result<(), Error>
```

MCP Tool Orchestrator:
```rust
pub fn discover_mcp_servers(catalog_path: &str) -> Result<Vec<McpServer>, Error>
pub fn bind_server_tools(server: &McpServer) -> Result<ToolChain, Error>
pub fn orchestrate_tool_chain(request: TaskRequest) -> Result<ExecutionResult, Error>
```

Revenue Analytics:
```rust
pub fn calculate_cost_savings(aws_cost: f64, local_execution_cost: f64) -> RevenueMetrics
pub fn track_productivity_gain(before_metrics: PerfMetrics, after_metrics: PerfMetrics) -> f32
pub fn generate_enterprise_roi_report(customer_base: &Vec<Customer>) -> EnterpriseValue
```

[Classes]
New classes extending AutoAgents foundation:

HeadlessBrowserController:
- Properties: wasm_runtime, sandbox_policy, browser_config
- Methods: initialize_browser(), execute_script(), capture_result(), teardown()
- Inherits from: AutoAgents tool runtime base
- Relationships: One-to-many with EphemeralBrowser instances

MCPGalaxyOrchestrator:
- Properties: server_catalog, tool_registry, execution_engine
- Methods: load_catalog(), bind_servers(), distribute_tasks()
- Inherits from: Actor coordinator
- Relationships: Many-to-many with MCP servers

InfrastructureAssassin:
- Properties: headless_factory, revenue_tracker, security_enforcer
- Methods: process_developer_request(), calculate_disruption(), optimize_execution()
- Inherits from: AutoAgents environment
- Relationships: Owns all components (browser, MCP, analytics)

[Dependencies]
Pure Rust/WASM only - NO external runtime dependencies:

New Cargo dependencies:
- `wasm-bindgen = "0.2"` - WASM function binding
- `web-sys = "0.3"` - Browser DOM access
- `serde-wasm-bindgen = "0.6"` - WASM serialization
- `gloo-timers = "0.3"` - Event timeout management
- `wasm-logger = "0.2"` - Logging in WASM

Existing AutoAgents crates to be extended (no new external deps):
- `core` crate: Headless browser integration
- `autoagents` crate: Ephemeral orchestration
- `derive` crate: Tool metadata generation

[Testing]
Zero-trust testing within WASM sandbox:

Test file requirements:
- `tests/browser_sandbox_test.rs` - Browser automation unit tests
- `tests/security_boundary_test.rs` - Zero-trust validation
- `tests/point85_performance_test.rs` - Performance benchmarking
- `tests/mcp_integration_test.rs` - MCP server binding tests

Validation strategies:
- WASM compilation verification per commit
- Performance benchmarking before phase completion
- Memory usage monitoring during execution
- Tool orchestration accuracy validation
- Revenue calculation automated testing

[Implementation Order]
1. Establish baseline system metrics and create performance tracking infrastructure
2. Implement headless browser spawning framework in pure Rust
3. Integrate browser automation with existing WASM runtime
4. Add MCP server discovery and binding capabilities
5. Implement self-destruction mechanisms for ephemeral tasks
6. Create unified tool orchestration API
7. Add security boundary enforcement across all components
8. Build revenue tracking and cost comparison dashboards
9. Performance optimization and bottleneck identification
10. Enterprise deployment containerization

⚠️ **CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:** Every phase monitored for RULE_MASTER compliance. No Python/Node usage allowed. Checkbox updates mandatory. Performance baselines tracked against AWS/Google competitors.
